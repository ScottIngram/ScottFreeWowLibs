# ScottFreeWowLibs
Miscellaneous lua libraries that I use in my own World of Warcraft addons.

### Usage

Go to your addon's file directory and execute this from the command line:

`git submodule add https://github.com/ScottIngram/ScottFreeWowLibs`

then in your addon.toc file add this line

`ScottFreeWowLibs\index.xml`
